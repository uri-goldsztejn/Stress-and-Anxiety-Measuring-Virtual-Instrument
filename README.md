# Stress-and-Anxiety-Measuring-Virtual-Instruments
A virtual instrument implemented on LabVIEW for physiological stress and anxiety real time monitoring.

LabVIEW can be downloaded from [National Instrument's (NI) webpage](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview.html#369643).

This project requires a blood pressure sensor and a galvanic skin response senor.
These sensors can be conected to a PC using NI's A2D boards.
